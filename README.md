# Credit-Card-Fraud
In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detection credit card fraud transaction using machin learning pyton librarues numpy, sckit-learn and few other libraries. we overcome this problem by creating a binary classifier using *logistic regression* 

Steps to solve the problem:
1. Importing the required libraries
2. Loading the data and data-preprocessing
3. Spliting ths data:Feature-Target split and Test-Train split
4. Building machine learning model
5. Model evaluation
